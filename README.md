# Twitter-Sentimental-Analysis
Modifying the conventional Support Vector Machines(SVM) Algorithm and implementing it in such a way that it can classify sentiments in more descriptive way.
Here we extract twitter data using Twitter API based on certain keywords and then that data is pre-processed to remove any unwanted data.
The classifier is trained using twitter corpus.
Trained model is then tested with new tweets and classify the tweets as 8 different emotions like sad,happy,excited etc.
